                <p> The Community App is a mobile app made for colleges to build a stronger community and for students to socialise, collaborate and study better. We realised the app in September 2020 and we had more than 500 downloads in one month, obtaining a lot of good feedbacks from students. 
                    We develop a second and improved version of the app, following students' suggestions, during the fall semester 2020. In the meantime we participated in numerous competitions to finance our app and ensure its operation.

                <hr class="primary">
                <p>During the spring semester 2021, universities started again to have some classes in presence and people started to meet again on campus. But while schools started to go back to normal, a lot of companies decided to maintain remote working and research shows that itâ€™s going to be like this for a long time. This is why we started to collaborate with a financial corporation in Pittsburgh, and we began to translate the app we built for colleges into an onboarding app that can help new hires feel more engaged and supported. Research shows that employees who go through a structured onboarding process are 58% more likely to stay with the organization for three years or more. Why? Because a well-designed onboarding program increases employee engagement and helps new staff members feel like a part of the team.
