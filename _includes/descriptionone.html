                <p class="text-faded">1/3 of Americans have displayed signs of anxiety, depression or both since the pandemic has begun and the long term psychological effects of this can last over a decade. 60% of college students, specifically, have experienced overwhelming anxiety and this figure has increased significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic, and college presidents are trying to help that. According to a Pulse Survey, 77% of college presidents have reallocated funding to address it. Through our research, we have grouped the problems faced by college students into 4 main categories: increased social anxiety due to isolation, lacking support systems and community disconnect, inability to ask for help, and lack of awareness of resources.  We know that remote learning is here to stay following the pandemic, so our goal as The Student Community is to tackle these 4 problems and help colleges create a community where their students feel professionally and personally supported during and after the pandemic.</p>
