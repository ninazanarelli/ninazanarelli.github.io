                <p>During the prototyping phase of the service we used a user, featured in the following video, who, guided by a member of our team, relived through the projection of images, videos and sounds, different moments of her past. All the data, images and videos collected were taken from her social media, or were requested from family and friends so that the user did not know in advance what would await her and could have an honest reaction to the projections that were broadcast. </p>

                <p>Thanks to the prototyping phase we then identified 4 steps through which a lost person should pass to find himself. Starting from a first phase in which the person relives the most painful memories of his life, we move to the second phase where the best moments are shown. In the third phase the user is encouraged to meditate on the two previous phases, and can realize that although there have been difficult moments in his life there have been as many happy ones. Finally, the last phase shows the passions, the things and the people loved; the user finally understands again who he is and what makes him happy.</p>

                <p>This project was subject to a long prototyping phase, made difficult mainly by the data collection that we had to do to make the experience as realistic as possible. During the prototyping phase we paid attention to all the details in order to make the environment suggestive, starting from the sound effects up to the use of lights of different colors for each phase. To find out more details about the process that led us to create animus feel free to check the booklet.</p>
